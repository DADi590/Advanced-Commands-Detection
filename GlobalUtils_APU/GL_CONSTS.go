// APU_ERR_PREFIX is the prefix to be used after MOD_RET_ERR_PREFIX and its additions to return a custom error (that is,
// an error that is not from third-party/Go libraries). A string must be appended with the format "X: Y", in which X is
// a unique error identifier (float - 1 or 1.1) for the submodule, and Y is an error description. A result example
// might be
// 		"APU error 1: Some description here"
