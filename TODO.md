# wordsVerificationDADi()

Put the assistant calculating some of the parameters for the function.

For example, it could see if with "set an alarm", "set" appears only in the first sub-array, it would set the
parameter to exclude that word from the list, but not if words are repeated on the sub-arrays!
Infinite parameters on the function but some automatic! Adaptable assistant by itself...!

Based on the content of some function arrays, it would adjust other parameters automatically without needing to go there
manually and hardcode it.


# NLP

"what's the time and the date please" - the keyword here is "and" --> do something about that? NLP... "verb name AND
name" (so it's the same verb for both names).
Also beware that the "and" is referring to some verb before or after it. So put the first names before and after the
"and" to the same action.
Except.... "airplane mode" --> both are names... Name immediately after name behaves as one name/command?

Also, ONLY USE NLP WHEN IT IS REALLY NEEDED! If not REALLY needed, use the function without its help (it may fail, like
with "turn on the wifi", on which it thinks "turn" is a name and not a verb - works in a bigger sentence though).

Use NLP to exclude other adjectives from the words_list if the only one was said already, for example? (Or a verb or
whatever) Of course, works only (as said) when there is only and only 1 adjective to form the command.
